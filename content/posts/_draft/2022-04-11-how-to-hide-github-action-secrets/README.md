Thank you for mention about this issue. I'm stuck with same problem and thank you all for your answers.

I just want to read some secret from encrypted files (like SOPS)  and hide it.

Here is my solution,

```yml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Mask Password
    id: mark_password
    run: |
      secret=`cat "README.md"`
      echo "::add-mask::$secret"
      echo "::set-output name=password::$secret"
  - run: echo "${{ steps.mark_password.outputs.password }}"
```

Here is result:

I think at the time in the step that we setting `add-mask`, somehow we should don't show the actual value on the console.

I hope this might be help.
