```js
// Compose our useMedia hook to detect dark mode preference.
// The API for useMedia looks a bit weird, but that's because ...
// ... it was designed to support multiple media queries and return values.
// Thanks to hook composition we can hide away that extra complexity!
// Read the recipe for useMedia to learn more: usehooks.com/useMedia

function usePrefersDarkMode() {
  return useMedia<boolean>(["(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"], [true], false);
}
