> Note: **This guideline is not suitable for default engine of GitHub (Jekyll)**. Because it doesn't allow to install any plugin. On the other hand, we can't use Jekyll 2 plugin. It must uses in Jekyll 3 way.

If you are a Jekyll user. You may be heard some news about announcement Jekyll 3.
Then, [GitHub announced to use the Jekyll 3](https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0).
So, there are many changes for Jekyll 3.
It describes in the [Jekyll Official page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/2-to-3/).

## Notices

- This article doesn't directly use to upgrade your Jekyll site, but it has some useful guidelines for upgrading by yourself.
- This article is following my site upgrading. You can see all changes in my commits ([1][commit1], [2][commit2], [3][commit3], [4][commit4]).

## Here is some instructions

- If you uses relative permalinks. It looks like `-relative_permalinks: true` in `config.yml`. *Delete it!*. Because it was removed from Jekyll 3.

- Some default plugins of Jekyll 2 (dependencies) are removed out on Jekyll 3. If you want use them. You just add import some Jekyll 2 plugins manually. I used my Jekyll site as a case study.

    Add `gems` and following a list of plugin name what you want in yaml format.

    ```
    gems: [jekyll-paginate, jekyll-gist, redcarpet]
    ```

    You can find more removed plugin lists of jekyll 2.x below:

    > - jekyll-paginate – Jekyll's pagination solution from days past
    > - jekyll-coffeescript – processing of CoffeeScript
    > - jekyll-gist – the `gist` Liquid tag
    > - pygments.rb – the Pygments highlighter
    > - redcarpet – the Markdown processor
    > - toml – an alternative to YAML for configuration files
    > - classifier-reborn – for `site.related_posts`

    >  From [Jekyll site](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/2-to-3/#dropped-dependencies)

- Jekyll 3 has been changed syntax highlighter to [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/).
I'm using `redcarpet` in my site because of I don't want to change any markdown files to support `kramdown`.

- In Jekyll 3, It doesn't  automatically add a trailing slash (`/`) of permalink (URL).

    - If you have custom permalink pages or posts, you should fix all of custom permalink posts and pages. By adding a slash (`/`) at the end of your custom permalinks. (You can see [my changes][commit2]) For example:

        `permalink: notes/vim`  change to `permalink: notes/vim/`

    - And, you should fix a custom permalink in `_config.yml` too. You can see in [my changes][commit3].

        `permalink: /:categories/:title` change to `permalink: /:categories/:title/`

## Lastly

Here is a part of `_config.yml` which is changed in Jekyll 3.

```yaml
markdown:        redcarpet
gems:            [jekyll-paginate, jekyll-gist, redcarpet]
permalink:       /:categories/:title/
```

Bye.
