- When I try to deploy Uptime Kuma on Azure App Service with Azure Files
  - It will throw error like [See more in uptime-kuma#1096](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/1096)
    ```
    [Error: PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL - SQLITE_BUSY: database is locked]
    ```

- Cannot use App Service with Kuma Uptime because Kuma require local SQLite
  - It's not recommended to use storage mounts for local databases (such as SQLite) or for any other applications and components that rely on file handles and locks.
